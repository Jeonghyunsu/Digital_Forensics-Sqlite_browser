# Sqlite_browser

This program is designed to output the information of a table obtained through Sqlite_fileCarving.dll.
Through a combination of WebView Cache and history, we have maximized the screen that someone approached at the time. 
In addition to simply configuring the WebView Cache on the screen, you can recover row data from any Sqlite database table.
